id3 tag parser written in objective-c. For use in Cocoa applications
Currently capable of parsing v2.4, v2.3 and v2.2 tags, for frames: All text frames (Txyz)

Usage is straightforward: send the parser class object a parseTagWithData:error message, passing in data
that contains an ID3 tag. The tag has to be well formed, meaning it has to be the whole tag. I 
suggest also passing in an error object although its not required. Function returns an array of dictionaries 
describing each frame in the tag. Returns nil on error. Check error object in that case.
